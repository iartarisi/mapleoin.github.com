        <div class="entry">
            	<p>With <span class="caps">GSOC</span> now over, which I should write a blogpost about soon, I&#8217;ve taken a break from pkgdb and web programming and started developing another skill.</p>

	<p>The fact that <a href="https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/users/packages/mapleoin">this page</a> is empty has been bugging me for too much time, so I set out to fix it. I also wanted to find out more about the packaging process and the road of a package before it gets accepted into fedora&#8217;s official repos which is a bit complex. This knowledge would also help me better understand the parts of pkgdb which packagers interact with.</p>

	<p>It was not my first time trying to make a package for fedora. I think this is actually my third time. I&#8217;d given up before, scared by all the different tools and scattered documentation. In a previous life, I had made some <a href="http://aur.archlinux.org/">AUR</a> packages, but the experience is a lot different. I&#8217;m now starting to get used to all the different tools that I was scared of before, like mock and rpmlint and I can now find my way around the fedora wiki for package related information. There is a wealth of information in the wiki, but you need a lot of patience.</p>

	<p>I started slow, with quite a complex application to package: <a href="http://calibre.kovidgoyal.net/">Calibre</a>. Having all those different distros is great when you&#8217;re a packager, because you have somewhere to look for help and the Debian package of calibre helped me a lot. It took me about two days to get a somewhat acceptable version of calibre packaged, which I then posted to redhat&#8217;s bugzilla. The following days I found more small apps to be packaged and it became easier and easier for me to do it. Last night for example, I was just browsing <a href="http://news.ycombinator.org">Hacker News</a> as usual when I found a link to <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/news.php?blog=1&#38;amp;story=301">facebook&#8217;s opensourcing of their web server framework</a> . I just rushed to the download and installation instructions page and I quickly got it packaged. I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s perfect, it probably needs a lot of improvement, but it was fun to do. It&#8217;s fun to think that you&#8217;re making things easier for someone and learning a lot at the same time. I now have 5 packages waiting to be reviewed and I&#8217;ve found someone willing to sponsor me into the <strong>packager</strong> group. Anyone in a package-review mood? ;)</p>

	<p>My journey into the packaging world has been enlightening so far and the good thing is I&#8217;m just beginning. There&#8217;s a whole new world to be discovered out there and also another part of the fedora community. </p>
